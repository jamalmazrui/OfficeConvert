OfficeConvert is a set of free, open source utilities for converting file formats using the COM-based APIs of Microsoft Office applications, including Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.  These are command-line utilities that operate in console mode, without a graphical user interface (GUI).  Many file formats are supported.  Common file extensions may be used to specify the formats desired.  Conversions include going to and from formats used by other office suites, such as the Open Document formats supported by the cross-platform, Open Office suite.
